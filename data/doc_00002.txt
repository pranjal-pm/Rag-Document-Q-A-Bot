The general principles governing the exercise of the discretion to award indemnity costs after rejection by an unsuccessful party of a so called Calderbank letter were set out in the judgment of the Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386. In summary those principles are: 1. Mere refusal of a "Calderbank offer" does not itself warrant an order for indemnity costs. In this connection it may be noted that Jessup J in Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 42 said that (at [6]): if the rejection of such an offer is to ground a claim for indemnity costs, it must be by reason of some circumstance other than that the offer happened to comply with the Calderbank principle. 2. To obtain an order for indemnity costs the offeror must show that the refusal to accept it was unreasonable. 3. The reasonableness of the conduct of the offeree is to be viewed in the light of the circumstances that existed when the offer was rejected.
