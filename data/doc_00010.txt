Hexal Australia Pty Ltd v Roche Therapeutics Inc (2005) 66 IPR 325, the likelihood of irreparable harm was regarded by Stone J as, indeed, a separate element that had to be established by an applicant for an interlocutory injunction. Her Honour cited the well-known passage from the judgment of Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148 (at 153) as support for that proposition. Had it not been for the fact that there will be a speedy trial of this matter, which Stone J regarded as a relevant consideration in Hexal v Roche (at [78]), I might have been inclined to grant some, at least, of the orders sought by CSL. I will give the parties an opportunity to be heard in relation to the matter of costs. I certify that the preceding one hundred and seven (107) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg.
