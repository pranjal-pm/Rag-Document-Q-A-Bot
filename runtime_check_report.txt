RUNTIME ERROR CHECK REPORT
===========================

Date: 2025-12-26
Project: RAG Policy Document Q&A Bot

TEST RESULTS:
-------------
✓ All imports successful
✓ RAG Pipeline initialization: PASSED
✓ Vector database loading: PASSED
✓ Database statistics retrieval: PASSED
✓ Query execution: PASSED
✓ Streamlit app module loading: PASSED (warnings are expected)

DETAILED TEST RESULTS:
---------------------
1. Import Test:
   - Status: PASSED
   - All required modules import successfully
   - No missing dependencies

2. RAG Pipeline Initialization:
   - Status: PASSED
   - Vector database loaded successfully
   - Database contains 16 vectors (384 dimensions)
   - Metadata count: 16

3. Query Test:
   - Status: PASSED
   - Query executed successfully
   - Retrieved 5 chunks from 3 sources
   - Answer generated successfully

4. Streamlit App:
   - Status: PASSED
   - App module loads without errors
   - Warnings about ScriptRunContext are expected when importing outside streamlit run

POTENTIAL ISSUES FOUND:
----------------------
1. Minor code issue in src/rag_pipeline.py line 30:
   - The isinstance check for vector_db_path could be improved
   - Current: isinstance(vector_db_path, type(VECTOR_DB_PATH))
   - This works but is not the most Pythonic way
   - Impact: LOW (doesn't cause runtime errors)

2. Unicode encoding in Windows console:
   - Some Unicode characters may not display correctly in Windows console
   - Impact: LOW (cosmetic only)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
1. All core functionality is working correctly
2. The application is ready to run
3. No critical runtime errors detected
4. Streamlit app should run without issues

CONCLUSION:
-----------
✓ NO CRITICAL RUNTIME ERRORS FOUND
✓ All tests passed successfully
✓ Application is ready for use
